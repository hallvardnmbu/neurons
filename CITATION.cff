  NEURONS is a neural network library written from scratch
  in Rust. It provides a flexible and efficient way to
  build, train, and evaluate neural networks. The library is
  designed to be modular, allowing for easy customization of
  network architectures, activation functions, objective
  functions, and optimization techniques.
